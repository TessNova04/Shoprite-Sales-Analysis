## Shoprite Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This project documents a comprehensive data cleaning and standardization process on a raw dataset. The primary objective was to transform messy, inconsistent data into a structured and reliable format suitable for analysis and visualization.

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project is a simulated user dataset containing information on user demographics, transaction history, and engagement metrics. It was created for the purpose of demonstrating data cleaning and analysis techniques. The dataset is not publicly available.

### Tools

 - Data Cleaning -Excel
- Data Analysis(Pivot table) - Excel
- Visualization - Excel
- Documentation - GitHub

 ### Data Cleaning/ Preparation

In the initial preparation phase, i performd the following tasks;
1. Data Loading and Assessment.

2. Problem Identification.

3. Handling Missing/ Null Values.

4. Adding Important Colums.

5. Convertinf Data From Formal Excel to Table.

### Questions Asked
1.Who are most valuable customers?

2.Which products are driving the most revenue?

3.When are peak sales periods?

4.How do different branches perform?

5.Which payment methods are most popular?


### Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows;

1. Our analysis shows that member customers are significantly more valuable than normal customers, contributing a higher percentage of the total revenue. This confirms that the loyalty program is a critical driver of sales and should be a focus for future marketing efforts.

2. The data clearly identifies the top performing products that generate the most revenue. The leading products are likely 5Alive Juice and Power Oil, followed by other popular items like Indomie Noodles. This information can be used for inventory planning and to cross promote with other products.

3.  Sales are strongest on Sundays and Mondays, with a noticeable dip on other days. This trend could be related to consumer shopping habits and provides valuable insight for optimizing staffing and restocking schedules to meet demand.

4. The data indicates that certain branches, such as Port Harcourt and Ibadan, are the strongest performers, while others may require additional support or promotional activities to increase patronage.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, i recommended the following;

-Enhance Member Programs: Focus marketing and special offers on current members to increase their loyalty and spending.

-Optimize Product Placement: Place the top performing products in prime locations to boost impulse buys and increase their visibility.

-Address Missing Data: To truly understand the impact of promotions, we need to get the data for discounts or special offers.
